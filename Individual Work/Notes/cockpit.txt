manifest.json tells the cockpit about the package
in manifest.json:
    1. tools subsection: each tool is listed in tools menu in cockpit
    2. path is the name of the html file that implements tool
    3. label is the text to show in the tools menu
we haven't told about the tool to cockpit so place or symlink in one of two places:
    ~/.local/share/cockpit
    /usr/share/cockpit

Download example to current directory:
$ wget https://cockpit-project.org/files/pinger.tgz -O - | tar -xzf -
$ cd pinger/

symlink to firstplace
$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/cockpit
$ ln -snf $PWD ~/.local/share/cockpit/pinger

Command for seeing the packages installed
$ cockpit-bridge --packages
